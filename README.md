# Classification-Model
Applied 7 different Classification Algorithm in same simple dataset to find out the best Classification Model for that particular dataset,
Features in the dataset:
* User ID 
* Gender 
* Age (used this one as first key feature (Independent Varriable))
* EstimatedSalary (and this one as the Second Key features (Independent Variable))

Using this two important features, Model will predict those users who are going to buy their product   

* Purchased (Dependent Variable(Binary Outcome(1,0))

# different classification models results
  1) Logistic Regression accuracy = 89%
  2) k-Nearest Neighbors accuracy = 93%
  3) Decision Tree accuracy       = 91%
  4) Random Forest accuracy       = 91%
  5) Kernel SVM accuracy          = 93%
  6) SVM accuracy                 = 93%
  7) Naive Bayes accuracy         = 90% 

For this particular problem Kernel SVM is the best classifier
